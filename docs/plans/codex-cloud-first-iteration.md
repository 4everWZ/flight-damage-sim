# Codex Cloud: core implementation plan

## Goal

Complete and review a buildable core-first foundation for `4everWZ/flight-damage-sim`, then improve it toward the preserved [original v0.1 specification](../spec/flight-sim-core-v0.1.original.md). [Current decisions](../decisions/current-decisions.md) own implementation rationale, measured evidence and model uncertainty. Preserve the original document unchanged.

## Working state

PR #14 merged as `686a79d` after PR-specific user approval; all four main CI jobs passed. The follow-up investigation stays on `feature/damaged-handoff-study`, extending its existing 20-flight handoff study with sustained measured loads. No further production repair is selected from the observations. Honor actual approval-review results; PR14 approval covers PR14 only. GitHub owns live PR/check status. Production aerodynamic-data/default-model adoption remains separate. Preserve user changes, original spec and isolated environments; add no Cloud agent configuration to Git.

The repository-local APEX skills preserve source content/license and do not modify global permissions, credentials or other projects. Static installation checks do not constitute skill behavioral validation.

## Current bounded iteration

The lagged/rate-limited reversal repair is integrated; preserve its [baseline and evidence boundary](../decisions/current-decisions.md#lagged-damaged-controls-within-tick-reversal-and-aerodynamic-impulse). The [damaged handoff](../decisions/current-decisions.md#damaged-mousekeyboard-handoff-bounded-flight-investigation) and [sustained-load continuation](../decisions/current-decisions.md#sustained-post-handoff-maneuver-and-actual-structural-loads) now provide 20 plus 16 measured flights. Full pitch produces ≈1.608 G at low energy, versus ≈5.023 G and delayed weakened-graph failure in the explicitly non-equilibrium high-energy entry. Actual graph balance/material recurrence and handoff remain consistent; no force-law/threshold retuning or new core repair is selected. Publish/review the diagnostic branch and its focused CI without merging merely for activity. Main integration needs its own authorization. The live step remains 120 Hz; human handling, historical validity and the original false 10% hypothesis remain separate.

### Previous clock investigation, completed on the earlier controller

The final discriminating experiment is complete: keep the physical kernel/actuators/rotor/structure at 960 Hz; independently change internal controller update, sensor read and request output clocks, then close at the native force age. The coarse endpoint matches the previous fixed-age run and the high endpoint reproduces the default native 960 Hz chain exactly. A separate 240 Hz sampled-system cross-check reproduces ~0.12181 m of effect disagreement on identical physical stepping, versus ~0.12418 m in the original native comparison.

That investigation selected no production/gain/acceptance change, and its original 10% hypothesis remained false. No interpretation of that acceptance expectation is adopted. The new control correction is selected from the separate force-balance and moving-aim mechanisms above. Its vector-load dependencies require complete v3 sensor records; current native-clock identities are rechecked without changing their limits. Older records and findings retain their earlier-controller meaning. Evidence and the unresolved expectation belong to [current decisions](../decisions/current-decisions.md#final-clock-decomposition-and-the-remaining-semantics-choice).

python3 tools/aim_tracking_experiments.py
python3 tools/propulsion_experiments.py
python3 tools/rotor_experiments.py

The headless path uses only GCC supporting C++20, GNU make and Python's standard library. The optional viewer/plots use Matplotlib. The [operations manual](../viewer-operations.md) contains the tested repository-local virtual environment and TkAgg startup, every input/damage command, telemetry interpretation and manual checks; Cloud uses `--smoke` instead of a GUI. Guidance and legacy propulsion comparisons remain available.
`build/flight-run data/validation.airframe <scenario> results/<prefix> [hz=120] [seconds=10] [controller=flightpath|flightpath-p|legacy|off] [bank_deg=40]` runs a single scenario; available names are defined in `src/runner.cpp`. The experimental 240 Hz option exists for convergence. Live mode is fixed at 120 Hz. Inputs and damage commands are applied at explicit tick boundaries; viewer rendering does not alter dt.

`results/summary.json`, `results/instructor-summary.json` and `results/propulsion-summary.json` and `results/rotor-summary.json` store fresh measurements and acceptance predicates; CSVs include flight, ownership, actual surfaces, stall counts and structural failure. `*.cells.csv`/`*.edges.csv` contain local end-state debug data. `experiments.png`, `instructor-comparison.png` and `rotor-governor.png` are scientific plots; `viewer-smoke.png` is a marked offline Agg rendering of live state; `viewer-input-summary.json` records input lifecycle checks with `human_gui_verified=false`. These generated results stay untracked.

## Next useful experiments

1. Finite-span/induced-flow reference is now measured independently. Next test an explicitly new opt-in section-data fixture and strip/cell load boundary, preserving real controls/structure; surface data meaning before any production adoption. Then prioritize local stall validation and calibrated propeller effects. The reference excludes arbitrary perforations, transient/stalled wakes and live 120 Hz cost. Clock experiments are finished: preserve the original failed 10% hypothesis and unresolved sampled-production versus continuous-limit interpretation; no new clock patch is selected.
2. Calibrate and extend the signed prop boundary before historical or transonic performance claims: independent blade/engine data, compressibility/tip/swirl/Re limits and shutdown/feathering damage. Numerical signed power balance, finite pitch governance and rotor/body flight ledgers now pass; this does not validate the synthetic airframe. Preserve the legacy three failed hypotheses. Broaden physically useful speed/load cases rather than tuning away those failures. Detailed sources/equations/measurements belong in [current decisions](../decisions/current-decisions.md).
3. Horizontal target-rate feedforward and consistent normal-load feedback merged in PR #11; retain their measured bounds. Keep legacy/off/P-only comparisons and failed altitude hypotheses visible. A later vertical-rate, stop/reversal or wider speed-envelope claim needs its own bounded evidence; no altitude-hold semantic is adopted.
4. Extend material mass bookkeeping and spanwise graph geometry/load mapping, then test large skin loss, critical spar hits and secondary detached-piece fracture. Explicit named material removal now updates the current component and accounts for removed parcels; automatic geometric damage-to-material mapping and full structural materialization remain pending. Current generalized graph statics are not calibrated local beam stresses.
5. Combined damaged linkage reversal, 20-flight handoff and 16-case sustained-load continuation are measured; preserve the negative full-stick-implies-5G observation and honest non-equilibrium entry residuals. Next improve physically justified load mapping/calibration or the local aero/control envelope, distinguishing aerodynamic bias from incremental authority. Do not retune damage/strength to manufacture a failure or a trim equilibrium.
6. Run the viewer on a desktop using the documented startup modes and record human observations. Cloud smoke validates transport/rendering only. A future FlightGear adapter still needs explicit aim/ownership and cell/structure telemetry.

## Blockers

No known build/test blocker; PR #13's configuration fix is integrated. This core iteration must observe its own PR and post-merge workflows; earlier green CI is not current-head evidence. The gh GraphQL PR-status call was forbidden; GitHub connector reads provide the remote workflow/status evidence instead. Cloud has no graphical display, so interactive human handling cannot be established here. The upstream APEX PowerShell package validator needs `pwsh` and the official `skill-creator` package; neither is installed, and neither is required to run this core. Historical aircraft data, detailed material calibration and full v0.1 acceptance remain project work, not completed claims.
