# Codex Cloud: core implementation plan

## Goal

Complete and review a buildable core-first foundation for `4everWZ/flight-damage-sim`, then improve it toward the preserved [original v0.1 specification](../spec/flight-sim-core-v0.1.original.md). [Current decisions](../decisions/current-decisions.md) own implementation rationale, measured evidence and model uncertainty. Preserve the original document unchanged.

## Working state

PR #1 was merged by the user after desktop fixes and passing CI. Main is `9f0bd7c` and includes user commit `1d6d837` (viewer performance, cleanup and corrected display). The user explicitly resumed automatic bounded core iterations on 2026-10-15. PR #2 (`feature/detached-aero-systems`, head `3799d4b`) remains an unmerged draft. The material follow-up is stacked on that exact head on `feature/local-material-mass`, with its PR based on the PR #2 branch; preserve all user work, use draft PRs, and never merge automatically. Cloud agent configuration is not added to Git.

The repository-local APEX skills preserve source content/license and do not modify global permissions, credentials or other projects. Static installation checks do not constitute skill behavioral validation.

## Current bounded iteration

Add explicit local material inventory and a conservative removal event. Recompute the current owner mass/CG/full inertia, recenter its state without moving the surviving geometry, and transfer removed mass/intrinsic inertia with the existing rigid velocity field into a separate passive body. Test attached and detached ownership, repeated events, total mass/P/H/instant energy, free flight, actual fixed-trim response and small positive parcels. No automatic area-to-mass or section-to-mass conversion is introduced; topology/damage state stays independent.

The material definition scales a declared element uniformly at a fixed centroid. Non-removable node carriers, no ejection impulse and no parcel aero geometry are explicit scope limits. The full-roll closed-loop small-effect 10% refinement hypothesis failed and remains in the report; fixed-trim response and instantaneous conservation have separate passing evidence. Cross-span structural mapping, physically shaped fragmentation and automatic material/aero/structure intersection remain future work. Preserve user viewer changes and the original spec; do not merge either draft PR automatically.

## Reproduce

```sh
make -j2
python3 tools/experiments.py
python3 tools/instructor_experiments.py
python3 tools/propulsion_experiments.py
python3 tools/rotor_experiments.py
python3 tools/detachment_experiments.py
python3 tools/material_experiments.py
python3 tools/viewer.py --smoke
python3 tools/plot_results.py
```

The headless path uses only GCC supporting C++20, GNU make and Python's standard library. The optional viewer/plots use Matplotlib. The [operations manual](../viewer-operations.md) contains the tested repository-local virtual environment and TkAgg startup, every input/damage command, telemetry interpretation and manual checks; Cloud uses `--smoke` instead of a GUI. Guidance and legacy propulsion comparisons remain available.
`build/flight-run data/validation.airframe <scenario> results/<prefix> [hz=120] [seconds=10] [controller=flightpath|flightpath-p|legacy|off] [bank_deg=40]` runs a single scenario; available names are defined in `src/runner.cpp`. The experimental 240 Hz option exists for convergence. Live mode is fixed at 120 Hz. Inputs and damage commands are applied at explicit tick boundaries; viewer rendering does not alter dt.

`results/summary.json`, `results/instructor-summary.json` and `results/propulsion-summary.json` and `results/rotor-summary.json` store fresh measurements and acceptance predicates; CSVs include flight, ownership, actual surfaces, stall counts and structural failure. `*.cells.csv`/`*.edges.csv` contain local end-state debug data. `experiments.png`, `instructor-comparison.png` and `rotor-governor.png` are scientific plots; `viewer-smoke.png` is a marked offline Agg rendering of live state; `viewer-input-summary.json` records input lifecycle checks with `human_gui_verified=false`. These generated results stay untracked.

## Original acceptance mapping

| Baseline requirement | State | Evidence / next work |

| §29–30 separation/feedback | Implemented reduced model and tested | Explicit material inventory now changes owner mass/CG/full inertia and tracks removed parcels conservatively. Graph connectivity, CG/full inertia and split momentum, elastic feedback. Detached cells now drive independent body motion; local control branches are unpowered/jammed. Secondary fracture, collisions, detached engines and inter-body wakes pending |
| §36–37 debugging | Partial, runnable and adapter-tested | Mouse/axes/throttle/three trim/prop/damage, per-axis ownership, lost-focus/pause/reset, CSV/JSON, forces/utilization. Full structural heatmap and native GUI/human handling validation pending |
| §33–35 projectiles/HE/fire | Not implemented | Follow core damage injection; do not replace it with HP |
| §38–42 aircraft reuse/fidelity | One data-defined synthetic fixture | Historical data and ≥3 substantially different aircraft remain pending |

| §48–49 first playable/full success | Not complete | Engineering viewer is available; finished sky/terrain camera and human flight-feel evaluation remain open |

## Next useful experiments

1. Calibrate and extend the signed prop boundary before historical or transonic performance claims: independent blade/engine data, compressibility/tip/swirl/Re limits and shutdown/feathering damage. Numerical signed power balance, finite pitch governance and rotor/body flight ledgers now pass; this does not validate the synthetic airframe. Preserve the legacy three failed hypotheses. Broaden physically useful speed/load cases rather than tuning away those failures. Detailed sources/equations/measurements belong in [current decisions](../decisions/current-decisions.md).
2. Add target-rate feedforward for continuously moving aim: current circle tracking lags by ~13°. Distinguish path tracking from absolute altitude hold; the latter is not the declared aim semantic. Keep legacy/off/P-only comparisons and the failed universal height-loss hypothesis visible.
3. Extend material mass bookkeeping and spanwise graph geometry/load mapping, then test large skin loss, critical spar hits and secondary detached-piece fracture. Explicit named material removal now updates the current component and accounts for removed parcels; automatic geometric damage-to-material mapping and full structural materialization remain pending. Current generalized graph statics are not calibrated local beam stresses.
4. Extend damaged range/friction/lag/hinge and saturation cases, and speed sweeps. Re-run impossible trim through actual available actuators rather than manufacturing equilibrium.
5. Run the viewer on a desktop using the documented startup modes and record human observations. Cloud smoke validates transport/rendering only. A future FlightGear adapter still needs explicit aim/ownership and cell/structure telemetry.

## Blockers

No known core build/test blocker. This iteration must observe CI for its own pushed head. The mechanics/Instructor revision passed all remote Actions steps; follow-up heads need their own observed result. The gh GraphQL PR-status call was forbidden; GitHub connector reads provide the remote workflow/status evidence instead. Cloud has no graphical display, so interactive human handling cannot be established here. The upstream APEX PowerShell package validator needs `pwsh` and the official `skill-creator` package; neither is installed, and neither is required to run this core. Historical aircraft data, detailed material calibration and full v0.1 acceptance remain project work, not completed claims.
